    "# Task 3.3: My Investigation into Advanced Audio Steganography\n",
    "\n",
    "## Personal Analysis\n",
    "After exploring the basics of audio steganography, I decided to investigate **Phase Coding**, a more advanced technique. What attracted me was its ability to make modifications to the phase spectrum, which is harder for attackers to detect compared to amplitude-based methods like LSB.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features of Phase Coding\n",
    "1. **Imperceptibility**: Small changes in phase are inaudible to human ears.\n",
    "2. **Robustness**: It is highly resilient to compression techniques like MP3, which often distort amplitude.\n",
    "3. **Security**: Statistically harder to detect due to the subtlety of phase alterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works\n",
    "- The Fourier Transform converts the audio signal to the frequency domain.\n",
    "- Secret data is embedded into the phase spectrum while keeping the magnitude unchanged.\n",
    "- An Inverse Fourier Transform converts the modified signal back into the time domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits\n",
    "- High audio quality is maintained.\n",
    "- Resistant to most attacks that degrade LSB-based systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Drawbacks\n",
    "- Computationally intensive.\n",
    "- Limited data capacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "In comparison to LSB, Phase Coding is more secure and imperceptible but requires more resources. If I were to choose a method for secure communications, Phase Coding would be my choice for its robustness and stealth."
